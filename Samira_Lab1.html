		<h1>Burmese Refugees: Religious, Ethnic, Climate </h1>

			We should have a mini introduction before talking about the different kinds of refugees.

			<div class="Text"> Refugees from Burma come from various religious and ethnic backgrounds, and account for one of the largest refugee populations in the world. In 2016, a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-myanmar-refugees-idUSKCN11Q2LK"> Reuters report </a> claimed that the number of Burmese refugees in the US is higher than the number of Syrian refugees in the country. Among them are Rohingya Muslims, Christian Chins and the Karen people, an ethnic minority in Burma who also tend to seek refuge in neighboring Thailand or Australia. Recently, Burma has also seen an increase in climate refugees who have been displaced following natural disasters.

		<div class="Text"> <p> The Rohingya people are an ethnic Muslim minority in Burma, making up about one-third of the population of the Rakhine state in the western region of the country.  They are denied certain citizenship rights by the Burmese government. In 2012, violence broke out when Buddhist nationalists burned homes and killed more than 280 Rohingyas, leading to the displacement of thousands of Rohingyas. In 2015, The Economist termed them as the world’s "<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21654124-myanmars-muslim-minority-have-been-attacked-impunity-stripped-vote-and-driven">most persecuted people</a>." </p> </div>

		<div class="Text"> <p>The Karen people are an ethnic minority in Burma who have been persecuted by the government since a civil war broke out in 1962. About 140,000 Karen refugees currently live in refugee camps in Thailand, and there are thousands more who have sought refuge in Australia. The Karen community is one of the 135 ethnic groups recognized by the Burmese government, and has fought against the government in the civil war for six decades.

		<div> <p>The refugees from Burma aren’t limited to religious and ethnic minorities. There are also climate refugees. In summer 2015, massive floods and landslides killed 172 people and displaced close to 1.7 million. Overall, it affected 9.5 million people, raising alarms among climate change experts who have urged the Burmese government to address this issue. </p> </div>
